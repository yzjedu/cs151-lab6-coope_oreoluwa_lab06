In this lab, the primary goal was to refactor the ATM application to ensure it incorporates proper error 
checking and modular functions. This exercise aimed to deepen my understanding of function design, input validation,
and the overall structure of Python programs. 

The procedure I followed began with a thorough analysis of the existing ATM application. I identified key functionalities
such as depositing money, withdrawing funds, and viewing the balance, and then outlined how to organize these into distinct functions.
To visualize the flow of operations, I created a flowchart that mapped out the user interactions and decision points within the application.
This helped clarify how to structure the functions and where error checking would be necessary. After establishing a clear design, 
I implemented the ATM program in Python, breaking it down into modular functions for each task. I incorporated robust input validation 
to handle errors for deposits, withdrawals, and menu selections. Following the implementation, I developed a comprehensive set of test cases
to validate the functionality of the error-checking mechanisms, ensuring they could handle both typical and extreme inputs.

The results of my efforts largely met my expectations. The refactored ATM program effectively handled valid inputs and provided clear,
informative error messages for invalid entries. I made sure to test the program using a variety of cases, including extreme scenarios like 
negative values and non-numeric inputs. This thorough testing confirmed that the error-checking functions were operational 
and that the program was robust against improper user inputs.

Throughout the process, I encountered several challenges. One significant difficulty was ensuring that all potential user inputs 
were accounted for and managed correctly. To navigate this challenge, I adhered to the first three rules of programming: simplifying the code 
wherever possible, maintaining consistent naming conventions, and testing frequently. By methodically iterating on the code and 
employing print statements for debugging, I was able to address and resolve the issues that arose. Additionally, collaborating 
with a partner provided valuable insights, allowing us to share ideas and troubleshoot problems more effectively.

Key takeaways from this lab included the importance of thorough planning and testing. Establishing a clear design framework and 
having predefined test cases significantly streamlined the implementation and debugging phases. Overall, I believe I achieved the learning 
objectives for this lab, gaining practical experience in function design, error handling, and user interaction.

Working with my partner was okay. We were able to identify the main tasks for the functions and work from there.
