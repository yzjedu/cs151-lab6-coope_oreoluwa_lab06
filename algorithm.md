   5. Otherwise:
      1. Output "Error: Invalid choice. Please enter D, W, V, or E."
   6. Return the updated current balance.
9. Define main_function
   1. Call display welcome function. 
   2. Initialize current_balance to 1000. 
   3. Set choice to an empty string. 
   4. While choice is not equal to SENTINEL:
      1. Call the display menu function. 
      2. Prompt the user for input and store in choice. 
      3. Convert choice to uppercase. 
      4. Call process choice function and update current balance. 
      5. Output "ATM program has ended."
10. Call the main function.
