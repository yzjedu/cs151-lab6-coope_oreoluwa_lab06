Objective:

What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?

- We were supposed to gain practice designing and programming functions, testing code, and using loops for input validation
and error checking

Procedure:

What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?

- We split the code up into functions and made sure they would still lead into each other

What were the Key concepts explored?

- Designing and programming functions, testing code, and loops

Results:

Did your results match what you expected to get?

- Yes

Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?

- A few

Reflection:

What challenges did you encounter?

- Finding out how to write the algorithm for the functions was somewhat difficult

How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?

- I did a lot of thinking before (and some while) coding, made the code more readable by using functions, and got practice
with functions

Did you overcome them, and how?

- Practice

Any key takeaways?

- Functions make organizing code much easier

Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?

- Yes
